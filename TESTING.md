# ðŸ§ª Testing Guide

## Quick Tests

### 1. Performance Testing
- Open app and check console for performance logs
- Scroll through pet list - should be smooth
- Switch themes - should be instant

### 2. Error Handling
- Turn off network and try to load pets
- Should show error message with retry button
- Retry should work with exponential backoff

### 3. Loading States
- Navigate between screens
- Should see appropriate loading indicators
- Loading should be smooth and responsive

### 4. Type Safety
- Check TypeScript compilation
- No type errors in console
- All API calls properly typed

## Console Commands

```bash
# Run automated tests
node test-refactoring.js

# Start development server
npm start

# Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Expected Results

âœ… All files created successfully
âœ… React.memo implemented
