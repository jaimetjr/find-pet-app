# ðŸ§ª Refactoring Test Steps

This document outlines how to test the recent refactoring improvements in your Find Pet app.

---

## 1. Automated Checks

### Run the Automated Test Script
```bash
node test-refactoring.js
```
- Verifies presence and integration of new features (performance, error boundaries, retry logic, types, etc.)
- All checks should pass (âœ…)

---

## 2. Manual Testing

### Quick Checklist
- Open the app with `npm start`
- Use the home screen and check the console for performance logs
- Scroll through the pet list and switch themes (should be smooth)
- Turn off your network and try to load pets (should show error message and retry button)
- Try the retry button (should attempt to reload with exponential backoff)
- Navigate between screens and verify loading indicators (spinner, skeleton, dots, pulse)
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript errors (should be none)

---

## 3. Console Commands

```bash
# Run automated checks
node test-refactoring.js

# Start the app
npm start

# Check TypeScript types
npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## 4. What to Look For
- **Performance logs** in the console
- **Smooth UI** with no unnecessary re-renders
- **Graceful error handling** and retry logic
- **Loading indicators** for all async actions
- **No TypeScript errors**

---

## 5. Expected Results
- âœ… All files created and integrated
- âœ… React.memo and useMemo optimizations working
- âœ… Error boundaries active and visible on error
- âœ… Performance monitoring logs in console
- âœ… Retry logic functional (with exponential backoff)
- âœ… Loading states improved and visible
- âœ… No TypeScript errors

---

## 6. Advanced/Optional
- Force an error in a component (e.g., add `throw new Error('test')` in a render function) and verify the error boundary UI appears
- Simulate slow network and verify retry logic and loading states
- Check memory usage and performance logs for optimizations
